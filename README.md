# Flappy Boy
This is flappy bird clone made for old GameBoy console. it is made with C and GBDK library. I hope this can be a helpful example for those ones who are starting witg Homebrew GameBoy development.

# How to build it
- Download the lastest binaries of GBDK
- Modify the run.bat file in the root directory to match the directory on your system where you downloaded GBDK
- Remove the last line and save it
- run the run.bat file
- A fist folder is going to be created with the ROM
